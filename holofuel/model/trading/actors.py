    Each actor produces and/or requires certain amounts of commodities
    (eg. food, goods, housing, labour) per time period.  The market should reach
    an equilibrium price for all of these, depending on their desirability
    (demand -- how many need it, and how much is needed) and rarity (supply --
    how many produce it, and how much is produced).

    Rather than directly simulating demand and supply to arrive at equilibrium
    prices, and controlling monetary systems to reach equilibrium PPM
    (Purchasing Power of Money), we create simple independent actors that
    actually try to sell the commodities they produce, to build a monetary
    balance, to fulfil their needs.  These commodities in supply and demand by
    independent actors create marketplace price and monetary purchasing power
    equilibrium.


    Different commodities have different levels of urgency, and will cause the
    actor to buy or sell at different prices.  For example, food must be sold at
    whatever the market will pay (or it will spoil), and must be bought at
    whatever the market prices it at (or the actor will starve).

    Labour will normally be sold at a certain price level, if the actor has
    excess money to purchase food/housing.  However, if the actor has no money
    for food/housing, the actor will sell labour at whatever the market will
    pay.  An actor with excess money may invest in education, to be able to
    deliver more desirable labour.

    Each time the actor is run, it may go into the market to buy/sell something;
    if other actors are in the market simultaneously with a corresponding
    sell/buy, then a trade may take place.
